# Fraud Detection System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using Machine Learning models.

## Models Used
- LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- Random Forest

## Techniques Applied
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- SMOTE for class imbalance
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation using AUC-ROC, Precision, Recall

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras

## Results
The models were evaluated using classification metrics to identify optimal fraud detection performance.
